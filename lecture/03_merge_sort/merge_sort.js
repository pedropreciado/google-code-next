// Implement the merge sort algorithm recursively. It takes an unsorted
// array as an argument and returns the sorted array.

// Here is an outline of how the algorithm works
//      1. Continue splitting the array until you get down to the smallest elements (1 element).
//      2. Compare adjacent elements and merge them into sorted arrays.
//      3. Continue to merge sorted arrays until the final array is completely sorted.
