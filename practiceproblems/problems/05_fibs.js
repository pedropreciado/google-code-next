/*
 * The Fibonacci numbers are a sequence of numbers such that each number
 * is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1.
 * 
 * fibs(N) = fibs(N - 1) + fibs(N - 2)
 * The first 10 numbers of the sequence are:
 * fibs(0) = 0
 * fibs(1) = 1
 * fibs(2) = 1 
 * fibs(3) = 2 
 * fibs(4) = 3 
 * fibs(5) = 5 
 * fibs(6) = 8
 * fibs(7) = 13
 * fibs(8) = 21
 * fibs(9) = 34
 * 
 * Examples:
 * Input: 2
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation: fibs(2) = fibs(1) + fibs(0) = 1 + 0 = 1.
 * 
 * Input: 3
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: fibs(3) = fibs(2) + fibs(1) = 1 + 1 = 2.
 * 
 * Input: 4
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: fibs(4) = fibs(3) + fibs(2) = 2 + 1 = 3.
