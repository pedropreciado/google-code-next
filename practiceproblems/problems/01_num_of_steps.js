/*
 * Given a non - negative integer num, return the number of steps to reduce it to zero. 
 * If the current number is even, you have to divide it by 2, otherwise, you have to subtract 1 from it.
 * 
 * Ex: numOfSteps(14) => 6
 * Step 1) 14 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 7.
 * Step 2) 7 is odd; subtract 1 and obtain 6.
 * Step 3) 6 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 3.
 * Step 4) 3 is odd; subtract 1 and obtain 2.
 * Step 5) 2 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 1.
 * Step 6) 1 is odd; subtract 1 and obtain 0.
 * Done.
